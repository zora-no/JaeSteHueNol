# SpaceTiles

Required Unity version: 2020.3.0f1

Welcome to SpaceTiles, our submission for the Advanced Experiment Design in Unity Seminar.
Simply clone the repo, import the files into Unity and create a build to start playing!

It is a splitscreen game for two players. 
You can navigate the menu using your mouse and close the game with Esc.
In  the game player 1 moves with W-A-S-D and can shoot with left shift/C, while player 2 moves with I-J-K-L and can shoot with right shift/N.

The goal is to score more points than your opponent before the time runs out, by hitting them with your cannon.
A number of powerups will spawn that can assist you. The most important ones are tile powerups. 
These be saved in your tile powerup slot until you hit a tile behind your enemy. Then they will permanently alter the arena, by changing the tiles behind them!
They can completely block the tile, slow the enemy, or spawn a cloud that blocks their vision.
Other powerups will give you an immediate, short lived advantage in battle. Try them all to find out what they do!

You can also find a short description, the credits and how to control your characters in the game.
